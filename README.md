## Overview

todo_app is a cross-platform mobile application built using Flutter. It provides users with a seamless and intuitive experience for managing their daily tasks.

*********************************************************************************

## Design Decisions

### User Interface

- **Minimalist Design**: The app features a clean, minimalist design to ensure that users can focus on their tasks without unnecessary distractions to allow users (add, update ,delete, view) thier tasks in a simple way.
- **Custom Animations**: Smooth transitions and subtle animations were incorporated to improve the user experience. Custom animations were implemented using Flutter's animation framework.

### Architecture

- **Bloc(cubit) for State Management**: Chose the Bloc package for state management due to its efficiency. This decision was based on the need for a scalable solution that could handle the appâ€™s growth.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Organized the code into modules to ensure maintainability and scalability. Each feature has its own directory, encapsulating its logic, widgets, screens and models.
